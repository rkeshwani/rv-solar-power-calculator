# Basic calculator for positioning over your RV roof and calculating power capacities
This projected was started as a quick project for a need I identified that currently doesn't exist anywhere. Thought it might be useful for RV users that want to install solar on their roofs and need help visualizing placements and calculating max capacities.

This project is deployed and available at https://rkeshwani.github.io/rv-solar-power-calculator/
